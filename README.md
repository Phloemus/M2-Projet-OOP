# Radiology database manager software

This software is an easy to use and secure medical database manager

# Description

The program is composed of a single C++ binary file and a basic small 
database composed of JSON files saved locally.

# Features

This software provide a simple interface allowing patients and doctors 
to access their radiographies and modify them according to their roles 
in the application.

# Requirements

Please make sure you match the following requirements before using the 
program.

* Compile with g++ on Linux (debian distribution recommanded)
* Use a Linux machine for execution

# Usage

Simply launch the program and start managing your own medical database.

# Technical details

Behind the scene, the C++ program uses classes and objects and try to 
respect as much as possible the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
principles and separation of tasks.

As expected, this program is composed of multiple C++ files containing
the definition of all the classes objects involved in the program and 
for the database object.

The database provided in this program is rigid, you will not be able to
define manually the relationships between the database objects but you
can take this tool as a ready to go solution for the deployement of a 
simple local medical database.
